# Pattern Recognition

This repository contains coursework, assignments, practices, and experiments completed as part of a **Pattern Recognition** course.

The focus of this repository is on the theoretical understanding and practical implementation of pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms, including:

- Linear classifiers
- Perceptron learning
- Least Squares classification
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Statistical pattern recognition
- Model evaluation and comparison

Each assignment is organized into its own folder with clear separation of:
- problem statements
- implementation code
- experimental results
- observations and conclusions

## Repository Structure
- Each `Assignment_XX_*` folder corresponds to a specific coursework assignment.
- Code is primarily written in **Python** and executed using **Google Colab**.
- Synthetic and real datasets are used depending on the assignment.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

This repository is intended for academic, learning, and portfolio purposes.
